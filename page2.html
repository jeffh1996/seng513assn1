			<span>The main map used for gameplay is the summoner's rift map shown below. There are two sides for two opposing 
			teams. A diagonal line can be drawn down the middle to separate the <span style="color:blue">blue team</span>
			and the <span style="color:purple">purple team</span>. <br></br>
			There are 3 lanes and a jungle on each side. Typically 2 people go to the bottom lane, and 1 person goes to the
			remaining 3 places (top, jungle, mid).</span><br></br>
			The objective of the game is to destroy the nexus in the enemy's base which is represented by the white circle.
			Each lane is protected by 3 turrets which are very difficult to destroy as well as one inhibitor which is represented
			by the white diamonds.

			Each lane spawns minions from each team's nexus. When a player lands a killing blow on an enemy minion they will receive gold which they can be used to buy <a href="page3.html">items</a>. Each team also has a jungle which contain
			neutral monsters (any player can kill them). They are much harder to kill than lane minions (but certain <a href="page1.html">champions</a> can still do it by themselver) can but drop more gold. <br></br>
			The two team's jungle is separated by an area called the river. The river contains two powerful monsters which usually
			requires more than one player (or even requires an entire team) to take down. These monsters grant powerful effects
			to the entire team of the player who lands the killing blow.
